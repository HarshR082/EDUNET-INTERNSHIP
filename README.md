## 🌍 Climate Risk & Disaster Management Project

### 📌 Overview
This repository contains my end-to-end project on **Climate Risk and Disaster Management**, developed as part of a structured weekly project series.  
The goal is to analyze, model, and visualize **climate-related vulnerabilities and disaster risks**, with a focus on building meaningful insights and possible predictive capabilities.  

By working through different stages, the project demonstrates a complete **data science workflow** — from data exploration to advanced analytics and visualization dashboards.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Streamlit)  
- **Data Source:** District-Level Climate Vulnerability Indicators (India) & related datasets from Kaggle  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Visualization:** Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit (for dashboarding)  
- **Deployment (future scope):** Docker, GitHub Actions, Cloud hosting

## 📅 Weekly Progress
### ✅ Week 1: Data Exploration
- Imported libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- Loaded and explored datasets (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull().sum()`)  
- Understood indicator keys & metadata  
- Prepared base dataset for further analysis  

.........more on upcoming weeks

## ✨ Unique Contribution
- Unlike generic disaster datasets, this project focuses on **district-level climate vulnerability**.  
- Incorporates **multi-dimensional indicators**:  
  - 🌪️ **Exposure** (climate hazard frequency)  
  - 🌱 **Sensitivity** (agriculture, population)  
  - 🛡️ **Adaptive Capacity** (infrastructure, resilience)  
- Develops a **Composite Vulnerability Index (CVI)** to identify **climate disaster hotspots**.  

---

## 📊 Example Visualizations (Coming Soon)
- Heatmap of missing data  
- Distribution of vulnerability indicators  
- District vulnerability ranking  
- Interactive dashboard (Week 5)
